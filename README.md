# Customer-Behaviour-Prediction

In this project we built a neural network to predict the customer behaviour using an audio app dataset containing a 2 years and 6 months data. The dataset has 12 columns and 14084 rows. We used the first two years of data as an input and the last 6 months as target(determining if a customer will convert or not). 

TASK:
Determine if a customer will patronize the company again or not.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
